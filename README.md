# Learning Resource Metadata Innovation Development & Guidance

The [LRMI specification](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) is a collection of classes, properties and concept schemes for markup and description of educational resources. This vocabulary is designed to be used alongside other resource description vocabularies such as those provided by DCMI, [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and other standards. A significant part of the LRMI specification is mirrored under the [schema.org/LearningResource](https://schema.org/LearningResource) class.

This repository provides in-development and informative resources about [LRMI](https://www.dublincore.org/about/lrmi/), including:
* [LRMI Terms](lrmi_terms/): development versions of RDF definitions of LRMI Terms in Turtle;
* [LRMI Vocabs](lrmi_vocabs): development versions of RDF definitions of concept schemes relevant to LRMI terms;
* [LRMI Examples](lrmi_examples): high level examples of LRMI.

For the stable, normative versions of the terms and concept schemes, see [LRMI Specifications](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) on the DCMI website.

## Show that you use LRMI

If you use LRMI metadata in your project or on your website you can help spread the word by displaying one of our "LRMI enhanced" badges. These are available in a range of pallettes and sizes.<img src="images/enhanced-Long_small+bright.png" align="right" />

For more information see [LRMI Enhanced](lrmi-enhanced.md).
