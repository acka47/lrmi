# LRMI Terms (Development Repository)
LRMI property and class definitions in RDF ([turtle](http://purl.org/dcx/lrmi-terms/)). May include terms that are unstable.

* The latest [stable, normative version](http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/lrmi_terms/) and a [release history](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/release-history/) are provided on the Dublin Core website.

* See [current issues](https://github.com/dcmi/lrmi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alrmi_terms) relating to LRMI Terms.

LRMI Terms are designed to be used alongside other resource description vocabularies such as those provided by DCMI, Schema.org, DCAT and other standards. The definitions here in the http://purl.org/dcx/lrmi-terms/ namespace, provide stability, a versioning information and some other additional information about the terms such as equivalents in other schemas.

Most LRMI terms are mirrored in the schema.org namespace, mostly under the [schema.org/LearningResource](https://schema.org/LearningResource) schema, which has wider recognition especially for use as in-page markup (e.g. as RDFa or embedded JSON-LD) for web resources.
